/*
Thread - 1 acquires a lock on Account A and then sleeps , giving
Thread - 2 to acquire a lock on Account B, Now, Thread-1 waits for
Account A & Thread - 2 waits for Account B. Since neither thread
releases the lock. Both keep waiting & thus creating a Deadlock ❌🔒

ℹ️ DEADLOCK Explaination : Deadlock occurs when each thread is holding
a resource & waiting for the other to release it.
